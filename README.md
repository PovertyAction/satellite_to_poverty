This repo contains two folders useful for prototyping the Satellite PPI.

* *nightlights_api* is a simple set of script that computes mean nightlight radiance for a given set of coordinate points. Please check the folder readme for instructions

* *predicting-poverty-replication* is a replication and some refactoring of some of the scripts used in [this](https://github.com/jmather625/predicting-poverty-replication) repo, which is the code used in Jeat et al.(2016). Its the same code but written in a slightly nicer way.
